This is a capstone project as part of [Google Analytics Professional Ceritification](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics)
* BigQuery / SQL used to aggregate 12 months trip data totaling to 5.8M rows into digestable data viz
* Applied ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYZE, SHARE, and ACT turning an abstract dataset into insights
* **Conclusion from the analysis:** To increase conversion from casual riders to annual members, Divvy should add the following to their membership perk:
  * Ride gamificiation to increase frequency of riders in the weekdays
  * Discounted rates for longer rides to entice casual riders who ride an average of 28 minutes versus 13 minutes of current annual members
  * Promotional credit for E-bikes as casual rider have higher interest in riding on electric bikes versus annual members
